#' Thin occurrence records to one per grid cell
#'
#' Occurrence records tell you where people looked, not where animals are.
#' Records cluster on roads, near towns, and wherever someone with a phone
#' happened to be standing. Thinning keeps one record per `km` and discards the
#' rest, so that dense sampling in one place counts once rather than three
#' hundred times.
#'
#' @section How this one works:
#' This lays a grid over the records and keeps the first record in each cell. It
#' is an approximation. Exact thinning guarantees that no two retained records
#' are within `km` of each other, which a grid does not: two records either side
#' of a cell boundary can be metres apart and both survive. The `spThin` package
#' does the exact version, and is much slower for it.
#'
#' Cell width is corrected by the cosine of latitude, because a degree of
#' longitude is about 109 km at the top of Australia and about 80 km at the
#' bottom. Without that, southern cells would be much narrower than northern
#' ones.
#'
#' @section Choosing `km`:
#' There is no principled way to choose this. Lamboley and Fourcade (2024)
#' tested filtering distances up to 1000 km and found no optimal value, and
#' further found that spatial filtering never improved model performance enough
#' to give accurate predictions. Boria et al. (2014) found the opposite. Both
#' are worth reading before you rely on this.
#'
#' Thinning is not the only response to sampling bias. Phillips et al. (2009)
#' fix the problem in the background sample instead, by drawing background
#' points with the same bias as the presences.
#'
#' @param occurrences A data frame with `lon` and `lat`
#'   columns.
#' @param km Grid cell width in kilometres.
#'
#' @return `occurrences`, with rows removed. Column structure is unchanged.
